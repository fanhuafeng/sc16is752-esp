Simple program to control the NXP PCA9685 LED PWM controller with an ESP8266.

This program:
- Initialises the NXP9685 device at its default address (0x40)
- Toggles all LEDs on and off
- Does this on a 2,000ms interval by default
- Uses brzo_i2c to control the I2C bus

This was verified using a PC9685 driving a ULN2803A, which in turn sinked current for a relay and LED in parallel.  The PCA9685 and ULN2803A were powered using 5V, and the ESP8266 with 3.3V, without a level shifter on the I2C bus (and the I2C bus was pulled up to 5V using 4.7K resistors, and it worked admirably).

Make sure you've clone this repo recursively (to pull in brzo_i2c) and then:

  make flash

to flash the module.

The baud rate of the ESP8266 will be 74,880 (using the default 26KHz crystal).
